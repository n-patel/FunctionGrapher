FunctionGrapher
===============
A Java Swing application which allows users to graph functions, change window variables/scaling, get function information from WolframAlpha, and save and load functions to files.

The project was created as a final project for my high school Honors Computer Programming 1-2 class as well as my final project for CS50 (Intro to CompSci I) through Harvard Extension School.
